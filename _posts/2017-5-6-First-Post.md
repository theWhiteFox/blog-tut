This is my first of many posts using

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jekyll-logo.png)

I have just cloned my blog repo locally. To edit I am using [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode).
What I like about Jekyll is I do not have to worry about a database connection and the secruity problems that come with that.
